# Mutation records — `tui`

Rows whose mutation broke code in `packages/tui/`, in the order they were
recorded. The root [MUTATIONS.md](../../MUTATIONS.md) explains the format and
the row fields.

| id | file | mutation | failing test |
|---|---|---|---|
| TK0029-M1 | packages/tui/src/client.ts | `401` fell through to the generic error instead of `TuiUnauthorizedError` | `TuiClient > turns each server error into its typed error and keeps the message` |
| TK0029-M2 | packages/tui/src/client.ts | `section` stopped sending `full=true` | `TuiClient > gets one object with its row, sections, actions and a URL-encoded id` |
| TK0029-M3 | packages/tui/src/client.ts | `act` dropped `confirmed` from the request body | `TuiClient > acts with a note, arguments and confirmation` |
| TK0029-M4 | packages/tui/src/discover.ts | a given `--token` was replaced by the home's token | `TuiClient > discovers the server from the home, and the flags win` |
| TK0029-M5 | packages/tui/src/events.ts | `reset` no longer cleared the old `Last-Event-ID` | `TuiEvents > an id the server cannot resume becomes one reset signal` |
| TK0029-M6 | packages/tui/src/events.ts | the reconnect sent a fixed id instead of the last event's id | `TuiEvents > a reconnect with the last id gets the event it missed` |
| TK0029-M7 | packages/tui/src/events.ts | a stream that closed without an event still reset the retry to the minimum | `TuiEvents > a stream that closes without an event keeps backing off` |
| TK0029-M8 | packages/tui/test/support.ts | closing a harness left its scratch home behind | `TuiClient > a harness removes its own scratch home and leaves another's alone` |
| TK0029-M9 | packages/tui/src/events.ts | a `401` no longer ended the stream | `TuiEvents > a bad token ends the stream after one error event` |
| TK0029-M10 | packages/tui/src/events.ts | a refused stream pushed no `error` event | `TuiEvents > 404 and 409 end the stream; 500 is retried with backoff` |
| TK0029-M11 | packages/tui/src/events.ts | a reconnect with no id to resume from sent no `reset` | `TuiEvents > a reconnect with no id to resume from sends one reset` |
| TK0029-M12 | packages/tui/src/events.ts | an event's id was not kept for the next request | `TuiEvents > the same instance reconnects with the last id and gets the missed event` |
| TK0029-M13 | packages/tui/src/client.ts | the abort signal was not passed to `fetch` | `TuiClient > an aborted request rejects with the abort, not an unreachable server` |
| TK0029-M14 | packages/tui/src/client.ts | an aborted request was reported as an unreachable server | `TuiClient > an aborted request rejects with the abort, not an unreachable server` |
| T-0030-M1 | packages/tui/src/state.ts | a cursor move near the end never asked for the next page | `the TUI reducer > moving past the end asks for the next page once and appends it once` |
| T-0030-M2 | packages/tui/src/state.ts | the two-pane threshold became `>` instead of `>=`, so 100 columns stayed one pane | `the TUI reducer > resize crosses 100 columns and carries the theme` |
| T-0030-M3 | packages/tui/src/state.ts | a Pending row lost its waiting flag | `the TUI reducer > each list maps its own flags to a row mark` |
| T-0030-M4 | packages/tui/src/state.ts | an appended page kept `loading` true | `the TUI reducer > moving past the end asks for the next page once and appends it once` |
| T-0030-M5 | packages/tui/src/view/index.ts | the waiting marker used the weak gray instead of the accent | `the TUI view > two panes show the header, a waiting marker and the footer` |
| T-0030-M6 | packages/tui/src/view/index.ts | the view always drew both panes, ignoring the width | `the TUI view > below 100 columns the right pane is gone` |
